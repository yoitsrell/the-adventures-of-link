# HTML II
### The Adventures of Link

---

### Project Skills

* Creating files from the command line.
* Linking html pages together using anchor (`<a>`) tags.


### Introduction

"Itâ€™s not unusual to find bookmarks left in a library book, but this time you've found a letter."

That is the beginning of our story. How will it end? How will it even _middle_? It's UP TO YOU.

What we'll be making today is a Choose Your Own Adventure story. In HTML. With links!


### Basic Setup

Our project will consist of a series of .html pages that we can link together using anchor tags.

Each page after the first one will:
* have a unique filename ending with `.html`;
* have the same title in its `<title>` tag as every other page;
* have, as its heading, the text of the anchor tag the user clicked on to get to that page;
* have a `<hr>` tags after the heading and after the main text, giving the sections some basic separation; 
* have some "main text" that describes what happens once the user takes the action that got them there;
* have at least one link (but preferably more!) that describes a possible action;
* have a link that leads back to the first page;
* and have a link _that opens a new window/tab_ and leads to the github repo for your app.


### Content

How the story progresses from that initial page is totally up to you, as is its length. There are no stretch goals here, per se; just keep making pages that expand your story!

Some content guidelines:

* As always, keep it [SFW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work).
* You should whenever possible branch out and give the user at least two choices for how to progress.
* We don't know what the letter is yet, what it says, or who wrote it. But we can be imaginative with other questions too. Where is the library? What kind of library is it? What is the main character _doing_ in the library? Who even _is_ the main character? Have fun with this!

Good luck!
