    <h1>You Rang the Bell</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>You ring the bell. This is the largest bell you have ever heard. It draws the attention of everybody in the library (all 5 of you). The librarian rushes out angrily. "What is the meaning of this?" You tell her what you found and give it to her. She looks over the documents, says thank you and disappears into the back. You wait for an additional 10 minutes. The librarian never returned. You walk away annoyed that you wasted your time.</p>
