    <h1>Reward</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>You take the reward box and open it. You feel a warm sensation all over. You look down and notice you are now wearing a security guard uniform. Ralph is in your clothes. Ralph screams, "Finally, I've found a sucker to switch positions with me. You are now cursed to be the library's watchman. You must spend the rest of your days harassing people for talking too loudly." Ralph gets up and runs out the front door. You chase after him, only to run into an invisible wall in front of the library. You realize your fate. You are stuck with the watchman's curse, whether you like it or not.</p>
